# Debt Visualizer
This was an entry project for the 2020 CodeRED Voyage Hackathon

### Inspiration
College students do not initially realize the financial commitment they're putting themselves through before seeking a loan. So we came up with the idea of a website to help them visualize their potential debt after graduation.

### What it does
Debt Visualizer takes information such as expected graduation date and degree and creates a chart for the user showing how much debt they'll have after graduation if they choose to take a loan.

### How it was built
We mainly used HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We used chart.js to produce the chart.
